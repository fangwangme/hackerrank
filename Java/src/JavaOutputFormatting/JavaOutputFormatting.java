 *
 * Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output.
 * The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output
 * using printf.
 *
 * To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor;
 * you must format and print the input to complete the solution.
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
 * Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters,
 * and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.
 *
 * Output Format
 * In each line of output there should be two columns:
 * The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
 * The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits;
 * if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
